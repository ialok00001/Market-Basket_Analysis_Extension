# Market-Basket_Analysis_extension_Basics

This project is just the part 1 of my main idea of using the Market-Basket analysis to identify classification rules in datasets of certain kinds, especially those in which the attributes are categorical. We wish to use this technique to find and learn how the attributes' values together gives us certain kinds of classifications. Note that it is different from the normal classifiers since in this case it is the user who is gaining insights of relations in the dataset.

For example, if we are given a bunch of lists with each of them containing a collection of words such as school, basketball, football, work, discipline, etc. and their corresponding target identifies whether a particular list of words belong to educational or a sports background. This is not as simple as it looks, for the word discipline can be used in both the cases, i.e. in an academic field or a sports field. So the collections of attributes together are important to understand these rules.

To implement such an idea, one has to recreate market-basket from scratch. This project contains the scratch part of it. It will also be a very good exercise to learn more about this algorithm itself.

Since this project is in itself somewhat big, I will be uploading its second part soon, which will incorporate this idea of learning from the data. There, I will be using codes from this project (with a few tweaks, which will be explained on the way) and add a few more for completion.
